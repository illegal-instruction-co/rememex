# MCP server

you know how every AI editor wants you to install some extension or connect to some API? forget that. recall-lite has an MCP server built in. one exe, stdin/stdout, done.

plug it into cursor, claude desktop, copilot, whatever. your AI can now search your local files without you copy-pasting paths like an animal.

## tools

### `recall_search`

full pipeline. vector search → keyword search → hybrid merge → JINA reranker. same quality as the GUI. returns paths, snippets, scores.

| param | type | default | description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `query` | string | required | what you're looking for |
| `container` | string? | active | which container to search |
| `top_k` | number? | 10 | results to return (max 50) |
| `file_extensions` | string[]? | all | filter by extension, e.g. `["rs", "ts"]` |
| `path_prefix` | string? | none | filter by path prefix, e.g. `"src/indexer"` |
| `context_bytes` | number? | 1500 | snippet size in bytes (max 10000) |
| `min_score` | number? | 0 | minimum relevance score (0-100), results below this are filtered out |

### `recall_read_file`

agent finds a file via search → reads it without leaving MCP. no more round-trips.

| param | type | default | description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `path` | string | required | absolute path to the file |
| `start_line` | number? | 1 | start line (1-indexed, inclusive) |
| `end_line` | number? | EOF | end line (1-indexed, inclusive) |

security: only reads files inside indexed container paths. can't escape to random system files.

### `recall_list_files`

get the project structure instantly. returns deduplicated file list with sizes.

| param | type | default | description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `container` | string? | active | which container |
| `path_prefix` | string? | none | filter by path prefix |
| `extensions` | string[]? | all | filter by extension |

### `recall_index_status`

agent checks if the index is fresh or empty before wasting time searching.

| param | type | default | description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `container` | string? | active | which container |

returns: `total_files`, `total_chunks`, `has_index`, `indexed_paths`, container metadata.

### `recall_diff`

what changed recently? call this at the start of every conversation to get instant context.

| param | type | default | description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `since` | string | required | time window: `"30m"`, `"2h"`, `"1d"`, `"7d"` |
| `container` | string? | active | which container |
| `show_diff` | bool? | true | include file preview (first 50 lines) |

returns: changed file paths, timestamps, previews, and detects deleted files.

### `recall_related`

given a file, finds other files with similar meaning. uses vector proximity in embedding space -- not grep, not imports, actual semantic similarity.

| param | type | default | description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `path` | string | required | absolute path to the file |
| `container` | string? | active | which container |
| `top_k` | number? | 10 | related files to return (max 30) |

returns: related file paths with similarity scores and snippets.

### `recall_list_containers`

dumps your containers. names, paths, descriptions, which one's active. no params.

## get the binary

grab `recall-mcp.exe` from [releases](https://github.com/illegal-instruction-co/recall-lite/releases).

or build it yourself if you're into that:
```bash
cargo build --bin recall-mcp --release
# sits in src-tauri/target/release/
```

## before you start

index some folders in the main app first. the MCP server doesn't index anything, it just searches. no index = no results = you'll think it's broken.

## hook it up

### cursor

settings → MCP → add server. or just edit `~/.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "recall-lite": {
      "command": "C:\\Users\\YOU\\recall-mcp.exe"
    }
  }
}
```

restart. done.

### claude desktop

edit `%AppData%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "recall-lite": {
      "command": "C:\\Users\\YOU\\recall-mcp.exe"
    }
  }
}
```

restart. done.

### VS code copilot

`.vscode/mcp.json` or user settings:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "recall-lite": {
        "command": "C:\\Users\\YOU\\recall-mcp.exe"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### anything else

stdio transport. point at the exe. no args, no env vars, no ports, no docker. just the path.

## teach your agent how to use it

hooking up the MCP server is step 1. step 2 is making sure the AI agent actually knows *how* to use the tools strategically. that's what [AGENT.md](AGENT.md) is for.

AGENT.md ships alongside `recall-mcp.exe`. default location:

```
%LocalAppData%\Recall-Lite\AGENT.md
```

every editor has its own way to inject project-level instructions. drop one of these in your project so the agent reads AGENT.md automatically:

### cursor

drop a `.cursorrules` file in your project root:

```
Read the file at %LocalAppData%\Recall-Lite\AGENT.md for instructions on how to use the recall-lite MCP tools.
```

or if you use the rules directory, create `.cursor/rules/recall-lite.mdc`:

```
---
description: recall-lite MCP tool usage
globs: *
alwaysApply: true
---
Read the file at %LocalAppData%\Recall-Lite\AGENT.md for instructions on how to use the recall-lite MCP tools.
```

### VS code copilot

create `.github/copilot-instructions.md`:

```markdown
Read the file at %LocalAppData%\Recall-Lite\AGENT.md for instructions on how to use the recall-lite MCP tools.
```

copilot auto-reads this file for every conversation in the project.

### antigravity (google)

create `.agent/rules/recall-lite.md`:

```
Read the file at %LocalAppData%\Recall-Lite\AGENT.md for instructions on how to use the recall-lite MCP tools.
```

antigravity loads all `.agent/rules/*.md` files as workspace rules automatically.

### any editor that supports system prompts

copy the contents of [AGENT.md](AGENT.md) into your editor's system prompt or custom instructions field. the file is self-contained, no dependencies.

## what happens under the hood

on launch it:
1. opens the same LanceDB the main app uses (`%AppData%\com.recall-lite.app\lancedb`)
2. loads embedding model + reranker from local cache (`%AppData%\com.recall-lite.app\models`)
3. reads your config (`%AppData%\com.recall-lite.app\config.json`)
4. sits on stdin waiting for queries

first launch is slow (~3-5 sec) because it loads ~1.1GB of embedding model weights + ~1GB reranker. after that it's instant.

## stuff that might confuse you

**no results** -- you didn't index anything. open the main app, index a folder, try again

**slow first query** -- model loading. chill. next ones are fast

**server not showing up** -- check the exe path. absolute path. double backslashes on windows. yes it's annoying

**searching wrong stuff** -- defaults to active container. pass `container: "Whatever"` to pick a different one

**access denied on read_file** -- the file isn't inside any indexed container path. index the parent folder first

**recall_diff returns nothing** -- if the main app was closed while files were edited, mtime in the index is stale. open the app and let the file watcher catch up

**recall_related says file not found** -- the file hasn't been indexed yet. index first, search second

## privacy

everything local. reads local DB, uses local models, talks over stdio not network. your files stay on your machine. that's the whole point.
