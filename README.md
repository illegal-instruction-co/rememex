semantic search tool for humans and AI agents. you type meaning, it finds files. nothing leaves your machine.

**windows 10+ only** for now. uses UWP OCR and mica backdrop. first run downloads ~2GB of models, needs internet once.

## why recall-lite?
| | recall-lite | [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) | [Everything](https://www.voidtools.com/) | [Sourcegraph](https://sourcegraph.com/) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **search type** | semantic + keyword hybrid | regex / literal text | filename (content via `content:`) | keyword + symbol + semantic |
| **understands meaning** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| **local & private** | ✅ everything on your machine | ✅ | ✅ | cloud or self-hosted |
| **file types** | 120+ (code, docs, images, configs) | text files | all files (index by name) | code repos |
| **image OCR** | ✅ built-in | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **EXIF / GPS** | ✅ reverse geocodes to city names | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **MCP server** | ✅ built-in for AI agents | ❌ | ❌ | ? |
| **price** | free, open source | free, open source | free | starts at $49/user/mo |

## what it does

- indexes 120+ file types (code, docs, images, configs, whatever)
- OCR on images via windows built-in engine
- reads EXIF → reverse geocodes GPS to city names. search "photos from istanbul" and it works
- EXIF dates → human words. "summer morning" finds a photo from july at 8am
- hybrid search: vector + full-text + JINA cross-encoder reranker
- smart chunking per language (rust at `fn`/`struct`, python at `def`/`class`, etc)
- semantic containers for isolation (work/personal/research)
- MCP server for AI agents. [details →](MCP.md) · [agent instructions →](AGENT.md)

## run it
```bash
npm install
npm run tauri dev        # downloads ~2GB models on first run
npm run tauri build      # release build, use this for real speed
```

`Alt+Space` to toggle. config & docs → [CONFIG.md](CONFIG.md)

RAM usage peaks during initial indexing — this is expected. once indexing completes, it drops and stays stable.

## agentic benchmark

same 5 tasks, same codebase. grep vs recall-lite MCP:

| task | grep | recall-lite |
|------|------|-------------|
| "find where GPS coords become city names" | grep "GPS" → 0. grep "geocode" → found file, need to open. **3 steps** | **1 step** |
| "find the quality filter threshold" | grep "threshold" → 0 (code says `>= 25.0`). **failed** | **1 step** |
| "find dedup logic for best chunk per file" | grep "dedup" → 0. grep "best" → noise. **3-5 steps** | **1 step** |
| "find config migration handling" | grep "legacy" → wrong file. **wrong answer** | **1 step** |
| "find embedding batch size constant" | grep "batch_size" → 0 (it's `EMBED_BATCH_SIZE`). **failed** | **1 step** |

**grep needs the exact keyword. recall-lite needs the idea.**

agents using recall-lite are expected to use 5-10x fewer tokens and complete tasks significantly faster. fewer search attempts, fewer wrong files opened, fewer round-trips. the benchmark above shows 1 step vs 3-5 — that's both speed and cost.
