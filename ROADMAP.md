# roadmap

- ~~**MCP server**~~ done -- `recall-mcp` binary exposes search as tools over stdio. any MCP client (cursor, claude desktop, copilot) can use it out of the box
- ~~**file watcher**~~ done -- `notify` crate, OS-level events (zero CPU idle), 500ms debounce. auto re-embeds changed files, removes deleted ones. `reindex_all` now does delta instead of nuking the table like a maniac
- **agentic search** -- local LLM that can grep --> read --> reason --> answer in a loop. notebooklm but private
- ~~**vibe coding / agent support**~~ done -- MCP server is now agent-optimized:
  - ~~bigger context per result~~ done -- `context_bytes` param, up to 10KB per snippet
  - ~~file type / path filtering~~ done -- `file_extensions` and `path_prefix` params on search
  - ~~configurable result count~~ done -- `top_k` param, 1-50 results
  - ~~agents can read files without leaving MCP~~ done -- `recall_read_file` with line ranges
  - ~~agents can browse project structure~~ done -- `recall_list_files` with filters
  - ~~agents can check index health~~ done -- `recall_index_status`
  - tree-sitter based chunking. split on function/class boundaries instead of byte counts
  - agent-triggered indexing via MCP (so agents can index new folders themselves)
  - the goal: make recall-lite the local private alternative to greptile/sourcegraph for AI-assisted coding
- **linux / mac** -- need cross-platform alternatives for OCR and mica backdrop
- **more file types** -- always
